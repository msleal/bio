My name is Marcelo Leal.

I'm currently working as Latin America, Managing Director - Hybrid and Multi Cloud Lead at Accenture.

I have worked in different companies and industries, being my last adventures as: 
- Storage Engineering and Architect Lead for the Cloud Infrastructure Services at Locaweb;

In this journey I got all five Amazon Web Services Certifications (Associate and Professional Levels), as well as all three for Microsoft Azure (Operations, Architecture and Development). 

I also have two specializations:

Thinking in terms of years, I have passed 30: Designing, Managing and Implementing/Leading Teams and all sorts of IT Solutions.
